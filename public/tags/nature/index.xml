      <guid>/post/q-a-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I got the opportunity to attend to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/&#34;&gt;SOKENDAI’s&lt;/a&gt; Freshmen course as a student committee member with 7 other students from various fields (from ethnomusicology, through space science to informatics). We helped to organize some activity to warm up new students and also presented our research fields. I really enjoyed to interact with nearly 50 new internation students, who just started their life in Japan. I hope I could make enough effort to help them enjoy these few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I would like to anser all the questions I got after my presentation, since we did not have time for everyone’s question. If you have any other question, you can ask me in comment or through e-mail. Let’s see the questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Why did you choose pitcher plant?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really amazed by carnivorous plants since I was a child. On science they catched me because of their complexity, elegancy and mistery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Please tell me, how do you spend your free time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like cooking, especially with my girlfriend. Also I watch several series, go out to explore the neighbourhood or just read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Is digestion mechanism of carnivorous plants same as ours?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually there is a lot of similarities, like the very acidic fluid with several hydrolases, however the actual enzyme set differs between animals and plants. Also carnivorous plants can use H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and specific plant enzymes, like chitinase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. How do you distinguish phenotype you observed was evolution not mutation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutation is random, and cannot set up a whole new organ with reproductive development. However evolution is a consequence from chains of mutations and selections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Have you ever observed pitcher plant in real or some other plants with similar nature?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunatelly I could never see Albany pitcher plant &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; in Australia, but i saw several other carnivorous plants in Australia, Hungary, Japan and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. I used to think that biology students have to collect the plants by themselves and go back to the lab to study them. So how do you work in your lab?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not collect my plants from wild, the easiest way is to purchase from a certified nursery or research center. For genetic/genomic/molecular biology studies we also try to keep the genetic background unchanged. It means, we established a line, and we maintain that with vegetative propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. What will you do after you finish this research topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think to finish the whole topic is impossible. In science if we generate an answer, that will trigger several new questions. I already have some questions I would like to answer in the future. Also I can recommend to always think in a “plan B”, if something unexpected delay happens with your main work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. How do you assign your time respectively for research in lab and entertainment outside?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do had to force myself to regulate my time. Continuous overworking is not effective, your brain and mind will be tired and cannot work as well as a fresh mind. My rule is to try to finish work between 5pm and 7pm (I start at 9am) and avoid to work on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. How is the distribution of the pitcher plant in the world?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 main pitcher plants in different families. The one I am working with ( &lt;em&gt;Cephalotus&lt;/em&gt;) is from a very limited habitat in SW-Australia. &lt;em&gt;Nepenthes&lt;/em&gt; is the tropical pitcher plant, can be found in Indonesia, NE-Australia, India and Madagascar. The third type of pitcher plants are &lt;em&gt;Sarracenia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Darlingtonia&lt;/em&gt; from North-America and &lt;em&gt;Heliamphora&lt;/em&gt; from S-America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. How do you study different academic areas and integrate them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a bit difficult to keep up with several communities, but you can benefit a lot if you understand several disciplina and can breed them to create something new and outstanding. As for data science, statistics and informatics, there are loads of online resources and active communities you can ask and learn from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Can you explain more about genome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome is the DNA content in a cell, which codes in a chemical sequence the informatin needed to regulate and express genes. Genes will eventually produce proteins, which are the “workers” of the cells, making structures, regulations, signal perceptions and transductions, catalyse metabolic precesses and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow my book analogy, then the genome is the dictionary: contains the words (genes) and the description, how to use them. If you would like to process to a specific developmental process, like making skin cells, you need to know which words/genes you should use and in what order, in what context. Finally you got a bunch of words and expression in an appropriate order. A book about “How to make skin cells”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. What challanges do you face in your research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot. Probably the biggest challange is to establish a new model organism and produce enough reliable result to be useful not only for me, but for future researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Is transcriptome of pitcher leaf and flat leaf known? If so, what differences did you find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is known and described in our paper: Fukushima et al, Genome of the pitcher plant Cephalotus reveals genetic changes associated with carnivory, Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution (2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In shortly, pitcher has a lot of digestive-related enzymes, higher wax synthesis, while flat leaf has higher rate of photosynthetic genes’ expression. In more details it is still under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Why are you interested in biology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very impressed with the complexity of life and would like to understand how this complexity evolved and works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Do you specifically study the interactions of genes that affect the formation of either a pitcher or a flat leaf?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I study how different environmental factors affect gene expression (including all genes) and how it is corresponds to phenotypic answer. Eventually I would like to find the regulatory mechanisms how a pitcher can form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. After one leaf dies, does the new leaf become the same type of leaf or change the leaf type depending on environment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is independent of previous leaf types, the plant integrates current environmental signals and make a new decision for the newly developing leaves continously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17. How interesting do you find to work with carnivorous plants?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am amazed by carnivorous plants and really glad I could start my PhD working on the topic I choosed. This passion gives higher motivation on work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. Are there any applications of this research in human systems?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the bioinformatics part in developmental process in genomic context, mammalian white blood cell differentiation is the mainstream with single cell transcriptome analysis. I hope the analysis method I construct will be applicable for any organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19. Is basic biology only contains plants?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. You can work with animals, plants, fungi, bacteria but even with only theoretical biology or computer simulation you can work on questions from basic biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20. Have you ever been stuck in research? How did you deal with that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course. In my opinion there are two ways to deal with this situation. First, you should leave it for a while. For a few days or weeks and work on some other part until that. After you go back for the part you struggled, you can think in a different angle or with new ideas in this case. The second method is more difficult for some cases, because this method is to ask help from others. Do not hesitate to discuss your problem with professors, postdocs, but even with other students or friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21. Why &lt;em&gt;Cephalotus&lt;/em&gt; relies on stocahstic determination of two leaf types rather then pure genetic way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is pure genetic way. For differentiation you often need external factors to decide the cell fate, which can come from environmental factors (like how temperature decides the sex of a crocodile in the egg) or from cell-cell interactins, like how white blood cells are differentiating continuously in your body based on the properties of neighbouring cells, or from internal, chemical environment, like pH or hormones, like how plant vascular elemts are differentiating. The stochastic property comes from the fluctuation of several internal- and external factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22. Can we measure the amount of data stored in a single cell?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using real single cells for genomic or transcriptomic studies is not impossible but also not easy. Current limiting factors contain the difficulty to isolate intact single cells from their tissue context without modifying any of it’s properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23. What is the happiest thing you find during your research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I understand something new, especially if I am the first who described and understood the phenomena. Also I find it very important to promote science for young people, so I did and will do several activities for young people to “plant the seeds of science”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24. What is the most important fundamental question in basic biology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic biology is very diverse field, it is difficult to answer. I think one of the biggest question is how cells can change their fate. It includes development, reprogramming, division axis change, differentiation and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25. How to exploit computational tools in bioinformatics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent trend in biology generates TB and PB scale data with sequencing technologies. We can benefit from several machine learning and statistical improvement from recent years. For example if you think about the genome, as a language, which has start and stop points for genes, specific motif, overrepresented areas, etc., we can apply several language processing apploications for better predictions. Also numerical data, like expression count can use several novel correlation methods since its non-linear and variable trending properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26. Did you plant your plants for experiments? How many of them you need to make your result statistically significant?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propagate our plants vegetatively in aseptic cultures. We plan to sequence hundreds of organs to be able to establish a propere inference from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27. Why and when did you begin to be interested in carnivorous plants? How many kinds of carnivorous plants grow in Hungary?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in elementary school when I got my first sundew. No need to say, it did not live long. My research interest for them woke up when i started my bachelor degree in biology and it is just growing since then. In Hungary we can find at least 7 native carnivorous plant species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28. What is the relationship between human and botanics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to understand this questions. But definitely human has a feeling for plants. When you go out and see the greens, the yellows, the flowers and leaves, people feel better. Also their are the primary energy source on Earth, they can transform the energy from sunlight to chemical energy, namely sugars. Also there are countless applications of plants, like clothes, building and furniture materials, medicines, decorations and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29. What is the result of not giving insects to carnivorous plants?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can normally grow without extra feeding, they will keep carnivorous structures and behaviours. Feeding can increase their fitness (leaf size, seed size, seed amount, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30. We only hace 3 or 5 years to do PhD. Is it ok if we choose research topic which is integrating from different fields?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is really beneficial for you and for your future. You can approach a problem from different point of views and apply techniques which was not available in certain fields. Eventually every new science fields comes from an interdisciplinary initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31. Does the flat leaf has more photosynthetic power?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we do not see the actual capacity for photosynthesis, the flat structure allows to harvest light at near 90° while in a complex 3D pitcher it is a much lower angle which decreases the energy available from the same amount of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32. What is the most difficult step in your research process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several difficult steps. Mainly the most influential is to design the experiments and properly sample the plants. These will generate the data I have to deal with later and I cannot change from that point, so it is very critical to do it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33. What decides a cell to be a particular cell?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow the book analogy, then the genome is the dictionary, which contains the words (= genes) and the description, how to use them (= regulatory elements). If you want to constract a working process, a sentence, you need to put the proper words in proper order. If you put several of these in a context, finally you get a book. How a cell decides what words or sentences to put? It is done by external (environment, tissue, neighbouring cells, chemicals, pH, hormones, etc.) and internal (differentiation stage, potency, internal chemical environment, availabel “factors”, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34. Do all carnivorous plants have similar structures?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, there are several types of traps, some of them can move really fastly and generates electrical stimuli similar to a neuron. Biggest part of them has sticky leaves, some has pitchers in different representations, some hose underwater vacuum traps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35. Do you like gardening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I like. I had several exotic plants ant trees when I lived in Hungary. Also I volunteered in a botanical garden to help maintain their collections and also to lead tours for groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36. Can you explain “stochastic determination”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stochastic determination means we can infer the probability to grow pitcher leaves in a particular condition, but it is never deterministic (100% sure). Let’s say, it is 80% pitchers and 20% flat leaves, then we cannot expect the order, but the overall distribution of the leaf types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37. Do you belive there is a “Designer” (e.g. God) or everything can be explained by science/biology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not belive in any supreme being, like god, but I do respect if anyone has a belief. However I also want to clarify it is important to separate “I understand” and “I belive”. In science we do not belive, we know things, understand, proved and so on. Science and belief can co-exist until you do not try to mix up these terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38. I wonder how to make models for computer based simulations on creatures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several models for biological systems, especially in ecological and neurological context. Deep neural network is modelled based on how neurons work in our brain. To simulate a whole organism, you have to implement all the known adn unknown factors which can affect the outcome, so it is pretty difficult. For more simple models, we can quantify the imputs we manipulating and the outputs (even in expression count or phenotypyc changes) and set up a model for the system. This is really common nowdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39. How to get data? Using a lot of carnivorous plants?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for phenotypic data, we need to use a lot of plants. Like we can measure the dimensions of every leaf. For genomic data, we have to isolate RNA from the cells and using specific technologies, sequence them. After that, we can quantify the representation of each genes in that experimental context. Now you have a count data for 20-30 thousend of genes, and you just used one plant. We sequence in very big amount to get response from several conditions, then try to correlate the environmental changes, the phenotypic changes and the genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40. Could you briefly introduce how to quantify biology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a description in the previous question. The idea is to measure more direct actions, like gene expression changes next to phenotypic (outlook) changes. Overall those expressions regulates the outlook. It is also important to measure everything instead of a simple description. If you want to say the leaves in one condition are bigger then in the other, measure the leaves and set up a model to the leaf size based on the condition. Now we are able to do this in big scale with high throughput sequencing and in a more “precise” reaction, on gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to give title to your top journal science article</title>
      <link>/post/how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article/</guid>
      <description>&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/htmlwidgets/htmlwidgets.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/blazy/blazy.min.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/pymjs/pym.v1.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/widgetframe-binding/widgetframe.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was interested in web scraping and text/sentinel analysis with R and thought for a practice I can check what are the most commonly used words and phrases in a scientific top journal, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/&#34;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencemag.org/&#34;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;. Since these are general science journals, I would not expect any scientific field can take the lead, but let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to access their page and see how their archive is built. If we can get some information where and how they store the issues and article titles, we can start with the &lt;code&gt;rvest&lt;/code&gt; package. Let’s see the case of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you don’t know how to access HTML/CSS tags and attributes, let’s check &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The first step is a right-click/ctrl-click on the page, the “Inspect”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I made a function to access any Volume - Issue pair on the page &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vXXX/nYYYY/index.html&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vXXX/nYYYY/index.html&lt;/a&gt; where XXX is the volume (&lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;) and YYYY is the issue (&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;). Luckily they store these in a consistent way, so we can easily get the titles from the &lt;code&gt;#research&lt;/code&gt; tag’s &lt;code&gt;hgroup&lt;/code&gt; html attributes. Firs let’s access the website with &lt;code&gt;read_html()&lt;/code&gt;, then we can extract tags with &lt;code&gt;html_nodes()&lt;/code&gt;. To transform this to a character vector, we use &lt;code&gt;html_text()&lt;/code&gt; and save all these in a &lt;a href=&#34;httm://tidyverse.com&#34;&gt;tibble&lt;/a&gt;. The last issue is v = 543 n = 7645, we can test with these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

nature_articles &amp;lt;- function(v, n) {
  read_html(paste(&amp;quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v&amp;quot;, v, &amp;quot;/n&amp;quot;, n, &amp;quot;/index.html&amp;quot;, sep=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% 
    html_nodes(&amp;quot;#research&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
    html_nodes(&amp;quot;hgroup&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
    html_text() %&amp;gt;% 
    as_tibble %&amp;gt;%
    return()
}

nature_articles(v = 543, n = 7645) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 28 x 1
##                                                                      value
##                                                                      &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;
##  1                         Astrophysics: Distant galaxies lack dark matter
##  2                       Biomedicine: An improved gel for detached retinas
##  3                    Physiology: Bone-derived hormone suppresses appetite
##  4                                                      50 &amp;amp; 100 Years Ago
##  5       Biogeochemistry: A plan for efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers
##  6                                          Ecology: Coral crisis captured
##  7                                          Cell biology: Sort and destroy
##  8                              Applied physics: 3D imaging for microchips
##  9           Molecular biology: A hidden competitive advantage of disorder
## 10 Mineral supply for sustainable development requires resource governance
## # ... with 18 more rows&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This selectors are only valid for issues since 2010. Before that you have to use different selector, but only until 1998. Before that It is also different and because the old static style of those sites, it is impossible (or at least very difficult) to fish out only the titles. If you want to play with the titles in 1998-2017 March, I uploaded a file &lt;a href=&#34;https://palfalvi.org/static/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/nature_articles_1998_2017.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s great, we can get one issue’s titles, but we need years of articles, which means hundreds -if not thousands- of issues. First of all we need the correct volume-issue numbers and hopefully the corresponding publishing dates also. Nature in this case also provide a nice solutions, an archive website, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/nature/archive/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/archive/&lt;/a&gt; where we can collect the necessary information. First of all let’s say we want to check the titles from 2015 and 2016. In this case our website URL modifies to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/nature/archive/?years=2016-2015&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/archive/?years=2016-2015&lt;/a&gt;. I hope you get the pattern, because we will dynamically change this part depending what years we need. Other parts are very similar to the previous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;years = c(2012:2016)

read_html(paste(&amp;quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/archive/?year=&amp;quot;, paste(years, collapse=&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;), sep=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  html_nodes(&amp;quot;dd&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%

##  [7] &amp;quot;7634&amp;quot;             &amp;quot;486-614&amp;quot;          &amp;quot;15 December 2016&amp;quot;
## [10] &amp;quot;540&amp;quot;              &amp;quot;7633&amp;quot;             &amp;quot;318-476&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! Almost. OK, there are 2 problems: 2 unnecessary information is joint at the and (ISSN and EISSN numbers), we should remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;issues &amp;lt;- issues[seq_len(length(issues)-2)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other one is the fact it is a character vector, not a data frame. If you look closely, very closely, you will figure out the 1st element is a date, then the issue, volume, finally the page numbers. This last one we do not need, so we will just discard, but the others still in a nice order we can use to arrange them into a tibble. Also there are some supplementary pages (SX-SY), those are generally replicated lines without the page numbers, so we will just extract the &lt;code&gt;unique()&lt;/code&gt; lines. Then we need to filter special issues, which happened just a few times, but always got the S1 issue label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;n_issues &amp;lt;- tibble(
  date = parse_date(issues[c(T,F,F,F)], format = &amp;quot;%d %B %Y&amp;quot;),
  v = parse_number(issues[c(F,T,F,F)]),
  n = parse_number(issues[c(F,F,T,F)])
) %&amp;gt;% 
  unique() %&amp;gt;%
  filter(n != 1)

n_issues&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 256 x 3
##          date     v     n
##        &amp;lt;date&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
##  1 2016-12-22   540  7634
##  2 2016-12-15   540  7633
##  3 2016-12-08   540  7632
##  4 2016-12-01   540  7631
##  5 2016-11-24   539  7630
##  6 2016-11-17   539  7629
##  7 2016-11-10   539  7628
##  8 2016-11-03   539  7627
##  9 2016-10-27   538  7626
## 10 2016-10-20   538  7625
## # ... with 246 more rows&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a data frame with one issue per line. To extract all the titles we will preserve this format and will use the magical list columns in tibble. To create the new column just use casually the &lt;code&gt;mutate()&lt;/code&gt; function from the &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; pkg. To perform our &lt;code&gt;nature_articles()&lt;/code&gt; function on every line, we will use the &lt;code&gt;map2()&lt;/code&gt; function from the &lt;code&gt;purrr&lt;/code&gt; package, since we have two inputs to this function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;n_issues %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(
    titles = map2(
      v, 
      n, 
      nature_articles
      )
    ) -&amp;gt; all_title&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;all_title %&amp;gt;%
  filter(lubridate::year(date) &amp;gt; 2011)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6,498 x 4
##          date     v     n
##        &amp;lt;date&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This can take a long time and even can reset with &lt;code&gt;HTML error 503&lt;/code&gt; if you want to collect a lot of data at once. Simply the website recognize your action as a bot or just cannot handle this many request. You can get a better chance if you put &lt;code&gt;Sys.sleep()&lt;/code&gt; with some random values in the function or randomly change the user agent with &lt;code&gt;curl::curl()&lt;/code&gt;. Check &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38119447/using-r-for-webscraping-http-error-503-despite-using-long-pauses-in-program&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and similar issues for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have the necessary data, so let’s work on it. First we have to &lt;code&gt;unnest()&lt;/code&gt; our data frame to have one title per line (or work with an already unnested data). Then tear them down to words and delete all the punctuation and case issues. For this the &lt;code&gt;tidytext&lt;/code&gt; package’s &lt;code&gt;unnest_token()&lt;/code&gt; function comes really handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. And let me work from here with the data from &lt;em&gt;1998-2017&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidytext)

all_title %&amp;gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, value) -&amp;gt; all_words&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can count the words and see the most frequent ones are …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;all_words %&amp;gt;% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 28,943 x 2
##     word    nn
##    &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
##  1    of 13961
##  2   the 12917
##  3    in 10037
##  4     a  7252
##  5   and  6685
##  6    to  4629
##  7   for  4257
##  8    by  2676
##  9    on  2329
## 10  from  1825
## # ... with 28,933 more rows&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… not those we want. “of”, “the”, “in” and so on. These are called “stop words”. To remove them we can use the &lt;code&gt;tidytext:stop_words&lt;/code&gt; data and &lt;code&gt;dplyr::anti_join()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;all_words %&amp;gt;% 
  anti_join(stop_words, by = &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 28,358 x 2
##         word    nn
##        &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
##  1   science  1735
##  2      cell  1424
##  3   biology  1192
##  4     cells   985
##  5     human   953
##  6  research   878
##  7   protein   804
##  8       ago   758
##  9 structure   739
## 10       dna   726
## # ... with 28,348 more rows&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are getting very close what we need (or now we think we need). Here already in the first two lines you can see the problem. “cell” and “cells” are independent entries. If we want to remove every modifications from a word, that is called “stemming”, since we will get the “stem” of the word. In the “cell”, “cells” case of course “cell”. There are several methods and packages, like &lt;code&gt;SnowballC&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hunspell&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;tm&lt;/code&gt;. Here I am using &lt;code&gt;SnowballC::wordStem()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(SnowballC)

all_words %&amp;gt;% 
  anti_join(stop_words, by = &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(word = word %&amp;gt;% SnowballC::wordStem()) %&amp;gt;%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) -&amp;gt; word_count

word_count&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 20,363 x 2
##        word    nn
##       &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
##  1     cell  2409
##  2   scienc  1794
##  3 structur  1285
##  4  biologi  1192
##  5 research  1065
##  6    human  1064
##  7  protein  1029
##  8    genom   952
##  9     gene   850
## 10    activ   822
## # ... with 20,353 more rows&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may ask why there are such strange words as “structur” and “biologi” instead of “structure” and “biology”. This is the result of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem&#34;&gt;stemming&lt;/a&gt;. “structure”, “structural”, “unstructured” and so on has the common stem “structur”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a fancy graph, let’s use the &lt;code&gt;wordcloud2&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(wordcloud2)

word_count %&amp;gt;%
  wordcloud2(backgroundColor = &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;, color = &amp;#39;random-light&amp;#39;, shape = &amp;#39;circle&amp;#39;, gridSize = 6) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;htmlwidget-1&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;height:350px;&#34; class=&#34;widgetframe html-widget&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/json&#34; data-for=&#34;htmlwidget-1&#34;&gt;{&#34;x&#34;:{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-12.html&#34;,&#34;options&#34;:{&#34;xdomain&#34;:&#34;*&#34;,&#34;allowfullscreen&#34;:false,&#34;lazyload&#34;:false}},&#34;evals&#34;:[],&#34;jsHooks&#34;:[]}&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in a little more usual form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;word_count %&amp;gt;%
  arrange(nn %&amp;gt;% desc()) %&amp;gt;%
  head(10) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(word, -nn), y = nn)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is already really interesting. We can see, in the past 19 years the word “cell” was the most popular, exactly 2409 times popped up in Nature article titles. “Structure”, “cancer”, “biology”, “gene”, “genome”, “protein” and so are mainly life science related terms. It looks like Nature is a bit biology-biased or just biologists produce much higher amount of data and publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world “cell” can be in many context, let’s find out in which context they appear the most (I bet stem cell and single cell RNA-seq are the most abundant, let’s take your bet, too). We can apply &lt;code&gt;unnest_tokens()&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;token = &amp;quot;ngrams&amp;quot;, n = 2&lt;/code&gt; arguments to pick up 2-word phrases (2-grams) and in similar way as before we can count them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;all_title %&amp;gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, value, token=&amp;quot;ngrams&amp;quot;, n = 2) %&amp;gt;% 
  filter( stringr::str_detect(string = .$word, pattern = &amp;quot;[C|c]ell[s]*&amp;quot;) == TRUE)  %&amp;gt;% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;htmlwidget-2&#34; style=&#34;width:95%;height:350px;&#34; class=&#34;widgetframe html-widget&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/json&#34; data-for=&#34;htmlwidget-2&#34;&gt;{&#34;x&#34;:{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-15.html&#34;,&#34;options&#34;:{&#34;xdomain&#34;:&#34;*&#34;,&#34;allowfullscreen&#34;:false,&#34;lazyload&#34;:false}},&#34;evals&#34;:[],&#34;jsHooks&#34;:[]}&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed “stem cell(s)” was the most abundant, but “cell rna” was less usual (only 6 times), even then solar cells (12 times), probably because these terms just became popular and single cell sequencing is available from the last few years only. “single cell” was occuring 24 times (as “single cell activity”, “single cell division” and so on next to “single cell rna-seq”). Let’s have a look on the articles with “single cell” in the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;all_title %&amp;gt;%
  filter( stringr::str_detect(.$value, 
                              pattern = &amp;quot;[S|s]ingle([:graph:]|[:space:]){0,1}[C|c]ell&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  select(date, value) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 30 x 2
##          date
##        &amp;lt;date&amp;gt;
##  1 2003-08-07
##  2 2005-07-21
##  3 2006-06-15
##  4 2007-06-28
##  5 2007-04-26
##  6 2009-02-12
##  7 2012-11-08
##  8 2012-07-05
##  9 2013-10-03
## 10 2013-08-29
## # ... with 20 more rows, and 1 more variables: value &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly the first article with “single cell” in the title just appeared in 2003 and after that only once in 2005, and once in 2006. Only from 2012 it became as popular to have some article in every year with the title containing this term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also let’s have a look on every 2-grams. Here I also separate the 2 words first to remove every stop word containing lines and stem them. Also “science” appears so many times due to article type headers, like “Material Science”, “Earth Science”, “Climate Science” and so. Because of this reason I filter lines, which contains “science”. For similar reason let’s delete lines with “review”, “highlight”, “research”, “biology”, “physics”, “journal club”, “…et al.: reply”, and “50”, “100”. These numbers from the series “50 and 100 years ago”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;all_title %&amp;gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, value, token=&amp;quot;ngrams&amp;quot;, n = 2) %&amp;gt;% 
  separate(word, into = c(&amp;quot;word1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;word2&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% 
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c(&amp;quot;word1&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c(&amp;quot;word2&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(!word1 %in% c(&amp;quot;science&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;review&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;highlight&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;research&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;biology&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;physics&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;journal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;club&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;communication&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;al&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;50&amp;quot;),
         !word2 %in% c(&amp;quot;science&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;review&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;highlight&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;research&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;biology&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;physics&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;journal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;club&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;reply&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;100&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(
    word1 = word1 %&amp;gt;% wordStem(),
    word2 = word2 %&amp;gt;% wordStem()) %&amp;gt;% 
  unite(word, word1, word2, sep = &amp;quot; &amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) -&amp;gt; ngrams_2

ngrams_2 %&amp;gt;% 
  head(20)%&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(word, -nn), y = nn)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, hjust = 0, vjust = 0.5))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;htmlwidget-3&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;height:350px;&#34; class=&#34;widgetframe html-widget&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/json&#34; data-for=&#34;htmlwidget-3&#34;&gt;{&#34;x&#34;:{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-18.html&#34;,&#34;options&#34;:{&#34;xdomain&#34;:&#34;*&#34;,&#34;allowfullscreen&#34;:false,&#34;lazyload&#34;:false}},&#34;evals&#34;:[],&#34;jsHooks&#34;:[]}&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, it is very clear &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;’s main focus is on stem cells. The second place is climate change, but still ~2.75x less occurrence then the winner. “Crystal structure” and “structural basis” are mainly protein or polymer structures, which is a very popular field. If you are working in &lt;strong&gt;material science&lt;/strong&gt;, better to go with these, or at least with carbon nanotubes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condensed-matter physics is yet another article type, looks like we couldn’t clean all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene expression, genome sequence/ing and cell cycle, DNA damage and transcription factor are the most popular molecular biology terms (of course after stem cell). If you want to publish a &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper, looks like these fields are the hot topics in &lt;strong&gt;life sciences&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are working in &lt;strong&gt;physics&lt;/strong&gt;, probably black holes and magnetic fields are the best choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the most popular biological model organism on full name: &lt;strong&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/strong&gt; with 68 occurrence in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; article titles within 19 years. However &lt;strong&gt;Drosophila&lt;/strong&gt; appeared 256 times. For a detailed look on the popularity of different model organisms, look at this table (human excluded, because it would take over everything):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;htmlwidget-4&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;height:350px;&#34; class=&#34;widgetframe html-widget&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;changing-paradigms&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing paradigms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far so nice, I am already very glad with these results, but there are one more aspect I am interested. Research trends are changing in time, for example 19 years ago there was no genome sequencing, which take the place of genetic mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all let’s see the number of words in every year.&lt;/p&gt;

  geom_line(aes(x = year, 
                y = sum),
            size =2) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look’s like in 2010 there was less publications or extra short titles. We can find out, if we just see the number of publications by year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;all_title %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(year != 2017) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(year) %&amp;gt;%
  summarize(sum = value %&amp;gt;% 
              length() %&amp;gt;% 
              sum()) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = year,
                y = sum),
            size = 2) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Number of Publications in Nature&amp;quot;,
       x = &amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;,
       y = &amp;quot;Number of publications&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like the publication number is radically dropped in 2010. I am not sure about the exact cause, but interestingly Nature Communications came out in that year in the first time also. Probably Nature decided to distribute the publications in several subjournals and keep just the top few in Nature itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;full_join(
all_title %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(year != 2017) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(year) %&amp;gt;%
  summarize(publication_sum = value %&amp;gt;% 
              length() %&amp;gt;% 
              sum()) ,
word_count_year %&amp;gt;%
  filter(year != 2017) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(year) %&amp;gt;%
  summarize(word_sum = sum(nn)),
by = &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;
) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(av_title_length = word_sum/publication_sum) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = year,
                y = av_title_length),
            size = 1,
            color = &amp;quot;dodgerblue&amp;quot;) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year,
                 y = av_title_length),

             size = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = word_sum/max(word_sum)* max(av_title_length)), color = &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = publication_sum/max(publication_sum)* max(av_title_length)), color = &amp;quot;green&amp;quot;, alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Avarage Title Length in Nature&amp;quot;,
       x = &amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;,
       y = &amp;quot;Words in Title&amp;quot;,
       caption = c(&amp;quot;Red line: average word number in titles (relative)\nGreen line: Publication number in issues (relative)&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer article number probably allowed slightly longer, better explanatory titles to articles. Other possibility is the increasing complexity of articles where finding an appropriate and short title is almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Detailed search on specific terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more we could do in general, but then I would never finish this post. If you have any idea please comment below. If you put some R code, or result on your work and founding, that is the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s have a look in some specific terms. Here I will focus mainly on terms which are relevant to my field, molecular biology, genomics and evolution. Also I will look for some global events’ influence, like some disease outbreak. I put the R code for every post, but will not explain them, since they are repetitive and relatively easy to understand. If you have different interest, then me, please show your results and findings and let’s compare what happened in the scientific life in the point of view of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Publication influence from main disease outbreaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look on major disease outbreaks from the past decades, like several flu types, Ebola and SARS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome&#34;&gt;SARS&lt;/a&gt; was the first big outbreak from this plot, which started in 2002 November in South China and presented for almost 2 years with around 8000 cases. In 2003 there was a peak in publications, then in 2004 it was reported much less time and did not appeared again until 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease&#34;&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; has a more constant base. It can be found in some African countries since 1995, but usually just a few hundred cases in a year. In 2013 there was a bigger outbreak in West Africa which was followed by a spread outside of Africa in 2014. Publication rate can give back this trend, with the peak in 2015, when scientists could react to the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza&#34;&gt;Influenza&lt;/a&gt; had several outbreaks with several strains. First H5N1 strain, which caused bird flu was discovered in 2004 and had publications in following years, 2005, 2006 and 2008. Swine flu (strain H1N1) was reported in 2009, and Nature had publication in the same year. FYI this is the same strain which caused Spanish flu in 1918. H7N9 strain of bird flu came in 2013, again the same year scientists reacted in Nature. There was recent outbreaks in 2016 October in China, so it is possible we can see similar trends in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As conclusion we can say that scientists and Nature reacted to these outbreaks and recently with less time delay, which give some hope for faster and more effective vaccination and/or treatment development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;appearance-of-genomics&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appearance of genomics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s see a little more abstract scientific world and search for terms and techniques relevant to genomic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA and genome has similar patterns, however genome has 2 bigger peaks. One was possible the first genomes, human genome project and so. Later the popularity of new generation sequencing techniques allowed to sequence in way lower price then before, and the “genomic era” was started in mid-late 2000’. RNA is probably the newest and most popular big target to genetic/genomic research now. Histone and epigenetic related titles accumulating much slower, probably the real breakthrough is still waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2000’ proteomic research was on top due to MS/MS possibilities, but unfortunately there is no new or highly advanced technique, although there was several improvement. Transcriptomic research started slowly, and noways it cannot stand alone as a Nature paper. Epigenomic had a few peaks, but started relatively late, only appeared in 2007. Still 2 years earlier, then the first interactome paper. Interactome requires much higher amount of data and labor work, so the popularity is lower or similar then any other “omics” topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can expect, a single PCR or Sanger sequencing is not enough anymore to publish in Nature. Microarray is not represented, but “seq” can be found in rapidly increasing popularity, as in RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and so. Exom sequencing is also a great technique, but limitations of available organisms are stopped the wide spreading (mainly used for humans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see the discovery and “incubation” of CRISPR, until researchers described the possible usage in genome editing. CRISPR/Cas9 is the first and most popular in use, but Cpf1 is also joined the race in 2016. Other genome editing methods are way underrepresented, as for TALEN system, there is only one data point in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;search-for-others&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Search for others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2017-08-08-how-to-give-title-to-your-top-journal-science-article_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not familiar with the really hot topics in physics, just wanted to show You can search for anything which is interesting for You. Probably You can explain more about the events in Your field, then me. For example why the terms “Higgs” and “boson” disappeared in 2009? Why “exoplanet” appeared in the same year? What kind of exoplanet topic made the 2010 peak? What happened in quantum physics around 2011 and 2016?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;section&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have answers or made a small analysis on your own interest, found some other way to analyse or just have a question, please comment below. As an extra exercise, you can do similar analysis, but in different journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
