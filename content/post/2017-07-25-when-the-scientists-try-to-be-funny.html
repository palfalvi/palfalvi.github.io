<p>Recently I had to browse through a lot of genes and sometimes my eyes are stopped in some hilarious gene names, where the scientists tried to give funny names to the newly described genetic elements. Here I just collected a bunch of them to share with You. However I found several website with similar contest, they mainly if not only wrote animal, especially <strong>Drosophila</strong> names, but my collection is mainly focusing on plants and Arabidopsis.</p>
<p>Maybe the most commonly used “funny gene name” is not even a gene, but a domain the RING finger domain. This is so commonly used, people just forget to stop at it and appreciate the ‘ring finger’ name. But the story does not stop here. What RING stands for? Here scientists focused on the abbreviation when they found this really interesting new gene, not on the “full name”. So it became a _R_eally _I_nteresting _N_ew _G_ene, RING.</p>
<p>There is a lot of gene names, which can be considered as funny, but they are just descriptive for the mutant phenotype with some extra good imagination. Like Scarecrow and pin. Then there is the moment when scientists are there, without a clue, what is happening, and just say “WTF?”. WTF was a gene later described, so they needed to change in the abbreviation to “What’s This Factor?”.</p>
<p>Time for Coffe WTF What’s this factor priority in Sweet life killing me slowly</p>
