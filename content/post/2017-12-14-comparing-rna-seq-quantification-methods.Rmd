I am in front of some big decisions now for my experiments, data analysis. One of them is the analysis of hundreds of RNA-seq data simultenaously, which can be a bit tricky. I would like to compare some alignment-free and alignment dependent RNA-seq counting methods to choose for my pipeline. The tools I compare here:

* kallisto
* salmon
* STAR-HTseq
* TopHat2-Cufflinks

The dataset I will try to work with is a published RNA-seq of the flat leaf and pitcher of __Cephalotus follicularis__ from [this publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-016-0059).
