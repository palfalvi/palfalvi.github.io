Shiso, or beefsteak plant (_Perilla frutescens_ var. _crispa_) is a plant in [Lamiaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamiaceae), the same family we can find mint, oregano, basil, lavender and a lot of other herbs. Its leaves are aten primarily in Japan.

In this post, I do not intend to discuss the biology of this plant, nor its use in the kitchen. I would like to communicate You a motto which you should understand and apply if you do any biology or bioinformatics, especially in collaborations. 

Although I do not consider myself an expert bioinformatician, I work with it daily and I am asked for help pretty often. Some help in an assembly, some remaining RNA-seq to be analyzed and so on. One thing which heard too often in these situations is 

> We did _this and that_ and now we have the raw data. What to do? Could you analyze for us? 

Well, you should have think about that when you set up the experiment. It sounds mean, maybe it is. But just think, how you would react if you get a gel electrophoresis photo without ladder or further info about the running conditions, and you need to analyze and make sense to it. Now you say, 

> That is nonsense, nobody would do that. 

And that is true. That is the point here. Why you would not do that in one case, but do in the other?

When you consider and plan an experiment, especially using NGS, think about the analysis pipeline, too. If you work with someone on the bioinformatics part, involve them in the experimental planning. Maybe they can point out a few things, you did not know or did not consider and it would ruin the whole experiment. Waste of time on both side, not to mention the financial requirements for some of these experiments. 

#### And this is **Shiso**.

It simply means, if you have a badly set up experiment, then do not except a groundbaking result from it. If you did not consider the bioinformatics when you started, do not be surprised if the result is not as you expected. 

Be aware, it does not mean that good samples always have good results. Things can go wrong sometimes and that is normal. But be aware of **Shiso**.
