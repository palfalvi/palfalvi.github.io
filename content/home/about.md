# Biography

I am a PhD student in the [National Institute for Basic Biology](http://www.nibb.ac.jp/en/) (NIBB), Japan in [Hasebe laboratory](http://www.nibb.ac.jp/evodevo/index_EN.html). My main topic is to find out how carnivorous plants' traps (pitcher, sticky leaf, snaptrap and so) evolved, how their development differ from a simple leaf. For this purpose we are using new generation sequencing methods (WGS, RNAseq, sRNAseq, ChIPseq) and more classical, molecular biology ways to unravel their secret. Next to the "regular" bioinformatics (assembly, annotation, DGE) I am interested in implementation of machine learning techniques and network approaches in biology.
